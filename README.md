# CandySpace Challenge

## The Architecture 
The project uses MVI(Model -View -Intent) which is basically an extension of the MVVM architecture. Since the data do not required to be saved to the memory, the Room intent has not been used for caching.

### Model

### View
### ViewModel
### Dependency Injection
### Repository
### Retrofit
### Utilities
Use RxJava(2) for handling async network calls
Use Retrofit2 for http requests
Use Kotlin instead of Java
